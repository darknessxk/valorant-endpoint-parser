# Valorant Endpoint Parser

Just a simple parser for the Valorant API endpoints.

The intent behind this project was simple as the following list

- I was feeling bored
- Saw a few log files related to VALORANT
- Started reading and seeking for something useful
- Found out the API calls are logged to those files
- Made this tool to extract the endpoints and put it all in one file to read in the future

Maybe you can find it useful as well, so here it is.
